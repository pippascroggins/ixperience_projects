                        I'm from New York, but that's sort of an umbrella term; I spend my time between the city, the suburb of Montclair, NJ, and the little beach village of Saltaire, Fire Island. 
                        I'm a rising junior at the College of William & Mary where I study computer science. I love my school! It's full of history  and it's home to so much of what makes me happy. At school, I'm the marshall of my sorority, Kappa Kappa Gamma, an avid Colonial Williamsburg walk 
                        taker, and a frequent admirer of the College Creek sunsets.

                        I didn't even know what computer science was until the second semester of my freshman year when I took the introductory class by chance. I fell completely in love with it! I'm 
                        still exploring what I'd like to do in the future, but I know for sure that designing products that have a positive impact on peoples' lives is most definitely in the cards for
                        me. I've read a lot about the history of computers, space travel, and the internet, so I've got a lot of inspiration.
